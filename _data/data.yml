    toolset:
      - name: Programming languages, frameworks and methodologies
        details: |

          - Object oriented programming using Ruby, JavaScript, Python
          - Full stack web development using Rails, Sinatra, React, Node.js, PostgresSQL, Firebase

      - name: Agile Practitioner
        details: |

          While working as a Mathematics teacher, I experimented with using the
          eduScrum framework with an A-Level class and used a Kanban board to
          manage the GCSE course team. This resulted in improved outcomes for
          students and led to other teachers in the department adopting Scrum
          rituals.

          Working in Scrum teams whilst at Makers, I have helped my teams
          discover and follow Scrum rituals and improved collaborative
          processes by using tools such as Waffle with GitHub integration.

      - name: Coaching & Mentoring
        details: |

          Since finishing the course at Makers I have supported other students
          in a role as an assistant coach. This involved performing code
          reviews for students on-site and support the delivery of the
          precourse for students off-site.

          As a Mathematics teacher I encouraged students to develop a growth
          mindset and helped prepare them for self led learning upon leaving
          college.

      - name: Quick Learner & Creative Problem Solver
        details: |

          I am an inquisitive, life-long learner and am at my happiest when
          learning something new.

          My teaching career and Mathematics background has helped me develop a
          strong problem solving process which I have been able to successfully
          apply in my work as a software developer.
